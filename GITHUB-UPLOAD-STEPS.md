# Step-by-Step GitHub Upload

## Step 1: Start Upload
1. Click the blue link "uploading an existing file" in the middle of the page
2. This opens the file upload interface

## Step 2: Upload Root Files
Drag these files into the upload area:
- package.json
- vercel.json
- README.md
- tsconfig.json
- tailwind.config.ts
- postcss.config.js

## Step 3: Create Server Files
After uploading root files, create server folder:
1. Click "Create new file"
2. Type: `server/index.ts`
3. Paste the content from server/index.ts
4. Commit

Repeat for:
- server/routes.ts
- server/email.ts
- server/storage.ts
- server/vite.ts

## Step 4: Create Client and Shared
Same process for client/ and shared/ folders

## Alternative: Copy/Paste Method
If drag-drop doesn't work:
1. Click "Create new file"
2. Type filename (e.g. package.json)
3. Copy content from here and paste
4. Commit each file
