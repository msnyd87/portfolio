The user has the page "https://matthewsnyder263.github.io/" open and an error message is shown in the DevTools Console for this page. The error message is wrapped within <DevToolsErrorMessage></DevToolsErrorMessage> below. Explain the error message and what could have caused it, and provide a way to fix it. <DevToolsErrorMessage>index-B6Ojm_Me.js:48 POST https://matthewsnyder263.github.io/api/contact 405 (Method Not Allowed)</DevToolsErrorMessage> index-B6Ojm_Me.js:48 POST https://matthewsnyder263.github.io/api/contact 405 (Method Not Allowed) Explain the error message from DevTools console
🚧 Error Explanation: The error message you're seeing—405 (Method Not Allowed) on a POST request to https://matthewsnyder263.github.io/api/contact—indicates that the server (in this case, GitHub Pages) received the request but doesn’t allow that specific HTTP method (POST) at that URL.

📌 What’s causing this?
GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service. It can serve HTML, CSS, JS, and static assets, but it doesn’t support server-side code or APIs.

The URL https://matthewsnyder263.github.io/api/contact implies you're trying to send data (likely from a contact form) to a server endpoint.

Because there’s no actual backend API configured to receive POST requests at that URL, GitHub Pages responds with a 405 error.

✅ How to fix it:
You have two main options depending on how dynamic you want your site to be:

1. Use a form submission service
Since you can’t run a backend on GitHub Pages, use a third-party service to handle your form:

💌 Formspree – https://formspree.io

📮 Getform – https://getform.io

📨 Netlify Forms – if you ever move to Netlify hosting

📬 Google Forms – embed a Google Form and style it to match your site

They’ll give you a custom endpoint to replace /api/contact in your JavaScript.

2. Host a backend elsewhere
If you need full control:

Deploy a backend (Node.js, Python, etc.) to a service like Render, Vercel, or Firebase Functions

Change the form’s action URL to point to your deployed API

Let me know how you'd prefer to handle the form, and I can help you with the setup or updating the JavaScript code to use one of these services.
