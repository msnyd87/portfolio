üö´ Error Breakdown: 405 Method Not Allowed

The error message:

POST https://matthewsnyder263.github.io/api/contact 405 (Method Not Allowed)
means that your JavaScript code is trying to send a POST request to the URL https://matthewsnyder263.github.io/api/contact, but the server at that address is rejecting it because POST is not an allowed method for that endpoint2.

üîç What Could Be Causing This?
Here are the most likely culprits:

GitHub Pages limitation: GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service. It doesn‚Äôt support server-side code or APIs, so it cannot handle POST requests to custom endpoints like /api/contact.

Missing backend: If you intended to have a contact form that sends data somewhere, you need a backend service (like a server or third-party form handler) to receive and process the POST request.

Incorrect endpoint: The URL might be pointing to a location that doesn‚Äôt exist or isn‚Äôt configured to accept POST requests.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Fix It
Here are a few options depending on your goal:

‚úÖ Use a Third-Party Form Handler
If you just want to collect contact form submissions:

Services like Formspree, Getform, or Google Forms can handle form submissions without needing a backend.

Update your form‚Äôs action attribute to point to the service‚Äôs endpoint.

‚úÖ Set Up a Backend
If you want full control:

Host a backend API using platforms like:

Netlify Functions

Vercel Serverless Functions

Firebase Functions

Then update your POST request to target that backend URL.

‚úÖ Change the Method (if appropriate)
If the endpoint only supports GET, and you‚Äôre not sending sensitive data, you could switch to a GET request. But this is rarely ideal for form submissions.
